Parameter Name,Description
rule_id,unique rule identifier (name of rule). NOT shown to the subject.
max_boards,max number of boards is a subject allowed to attempt for this rule
max_points,this will determine the maximum number of points a subject is allowed to earn from clearing a board (used as parameter in the point calculation formula)
min_points, this will determine the min number of points a subject is allowed to earn if they don’t clear the board in max_boards attempts
activate_bonus_at,this determines when (on which board) “Activate bonus” option is available to them. This is the board at which they can try to guess the rule and see whether their
min_objects,minimum number of objects to be displayed on the board for this rule
max_objects,maximum number of objects to be displayed on the board for this rule
min_shapes,minimum number of unique shapes to be displayed on the board for this rule
max_shapes,maximum number of unique shapes to be displayed on the board for this rule
min_colors,minimum number of unique colors to be displayed on the board for this rule
max_colors,maximum number of unique colors to be displayed on the board for this rule
f,rate of point falloff
m,max number of points possible for this rule
n,y-offset (min points possible.. will be adjusted together with m)
b,another rate of point falloff parameter
clear_how_many,"(if they successfully clear the next clear_how_many boards, they get bonus_amt extra points"
bonus_extra_pts,number of bonus points awarded for clearing clear_how_many boards successfully
clearing_threshold,"determines what counts as successfully clearing a board. 1.2 means the person is allowed to make 1.2 * number_of_starting_shapes moves (move = putting object in a bucket or attempting to; in other words, a drag and release). This parameter  should be the next integer higher than ct*noss."
feedback_switches,"This are  switches controlling the degree of feedback that the game provides to the player. It may not be a part of the game, as it may be overridden by a control imposed per subject, in the experimental design
fixed = (current default). Unmovable objects are marked with an X
free = no objects are marked with X. Seeking to move an object is counted as some fraction of a move. 
new_display_trigger = number of wrong drop attempts allowed. When this is exceeded a new display is draw. defaul = inf
free_trigger = number of wrong attempts to move an object, default=inf
free_wrong_cost = fraction of a move charged for wrong attempt to move. non-neagtive real. default = 0. "
stack_memory_depth,"controls how many dropped objects show in the stack or ""beaker"" next to each bucket. . Currently accomodates at least 16. Objects shrink as the stack gets too big. "
stack_memory_show_order,TRUE: the drop order of each move is displayed next to the object in the stack; default: FALSE
grid_memory_show_order,"TRUE: instead of a check mark, the drop order of the object is displayed over the image; default FALSE"
