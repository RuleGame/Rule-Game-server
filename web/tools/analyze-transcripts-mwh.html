<h1>Processing human players' transcripts for Mann-Whitney comparison</h1>

<div align="center"><em>Updated 2023-01-09, for Game Server 6.004</em></div>

<p>This document desribes the functionality of the script <tt>scripts/analyze-transcripts-mwh.sh</tt>, which is designed to analyze human players' transcripts in order to compare rule sets with respect to their ease/difficulty for the human players' population.

<p>This command-line script accesses the same functionality as the <a href="mw-human-form.jsp">web interface</a>, but also has some additional functionality which allows you to separate the stages of transcript analysis and M-W comparison.

  <h2>Usage</h2>

<p>There are 3 modes:

  <h3>(1) Extracting data from transcripts, and using them for M-W test.</h3>

  You just need to specify the names of the experiment plans. All transcripts of players assigned to those plans will be used in the analysis; the M-W compaison will include or rule sets (or, more, precisely, "experiences") experinced by these players.

  <p>(The script is actually in <tt>/home/vmenkov/w2022/game/scripts</tt> on sapir; so you can add that directory to your PATH, or just type the full path).

  <pre>scripts/analyze-transcripts-mwh.sh  <em>[extractionOptions] [MWOptons] [otherOptions] plan1 [plan2 ...]</em>
  </pre>

  Example:
  <pre>scripts/analyze-transcripts-mwh.sh ep/rule_ambiguity/ambiguity1 ep/rule_ambiguity/ambiguity2 ep/rule_ambiguity/ambiguity3 ep/rule_ambiguity/ambiguity4
</pre>

<p>Extraction options:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>-targetStreak 10</tt> : this is how many consecutive error-free moves the player must make in order to demonstrate successful learning.
    <li><tt>-defaultMStar 300</tt> : this value the program will assign as <em>m<sub>*</sub></em> (mStar) to the players who have failed to learn (as per the above criterion) the rule set they were playing. You can use the value <tt>Infinity</tt> to ensure that all non-learners are distinct from all learners; however, any positive value that's larger than the maximum number of moves in any player's series will work just as well. Because M-W is based on comparisons, 300 will work exactly the same way as  <tt>Infinity</tt> as long as no successful player has put more than 300 move attempts into any rule set.
  </ul>

<p>Other options:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>-file</tt> : if this option is used, then instead of listing plan names on the command line, you can put them into a file (one name perl line), and put that file name's on the command line. This may be handy if you want to look at data from a large number of plans.
  </ul>

<p>M-W options:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>-precMode [Naive | Every | Ignore]</tt> : This controls how different series are assigned to different "experiences" to be compared. This is how the 3 modes work:
      <ul>
	<li><tt>Naive</tt> (the default mode): For each rule sets, only include "naive" players (those who played this rule set as their first rule set). In other word, if a player played 3 rules sets, R1, R2, and R3, in this order, then only his experience of playing R1 is analyzed.
<li><tt>Every</tt> Consider each (rule set + preceding set) combination as a separate experience to be ranked. (That is,
the R1 data from <strong>R1</strong>:R2:R3,  
R2:<strong>R1</strong>:R3, and
R2:R3:<strong>R1</strong> are viewed as belonging to three distinct experiences, "R1", "R2:R1", and "R2:R3:R1")
<li><tt>Ignore</tt>Ignore: When viewing a rule set's series, ignore preceding rule sets. (In other words, the R1 data from
<strong>R1</strong>:R2:R3,  
R2:<strong>R1</strong>:R3, and
R2:R3:<strong>R1</strong> are merged, viewed as the same "R1 experience").
      </ul>
  </ul>

    <h3>(2) Extracting data from transcripts, and saving them to file.</h3>
  
<p>Use this mode if you want to post-process the mStar data. 

  <pre>scripts/analyze-transcripts-mwh.sh  <em>[extractionOptions] [otherOptions]</em> -export outputFileName.csv <em>plan1 [plan2 ...]</em>
</pre>

<p>The transcript data will be extracted in the same way as in (1), but, in addition to performing the M-W comparison, the extracted and processed data will also be saved in a CSV file to the specified. The program will also carry out the same M-W computations as in (1).

  <p>The output file will be in the following format:
  
<pre>
#ruleSetName,precedingRules,exp,trialListId,seriesNo,playerId,learned,total_moves,total_errors,mStar
ep/1_1_color_4m,,ep/rule_ambiguity/ambiguity4,ambiguity4_4,0,A016079037TD5GXCNYBPH,false,99,47,300.0
ep/col_ord_rbyg_1_4,ep/1_1_color_4m,ep/rule_ambiguity/ambiguity4,ambiguity4_4,1,A016079037TD5GXCNYBPH,false,90,49,300.0
ep/shape_ord_SqCTSt_1_4,ep/1_1_color_4m;ep/col_ord_rbyg_1_4,ep/rule_ambiguity/ambiguity4,ambiguity4_4,2,A016079037TD5GXCNYBPH,false,98,58,300.0
ep/1_2_color_4m,,ep/rule_ambiguity/ambiguity4,ambiguity4_6,0,A10G8U9316K46H,false,52,16,300.0
   ...  ... ...
</pre>

<p>In the output file, each line (after the header line) corresponds to 1 series, i.e. the series of episodes played by one player against one rule set. The meaning of the columns is as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>ruleSetName - the rule set being played
    <li>precedingRules - the semicolon-separated list of rule sets, if any, this player played before encountering this rule set
    <li>exp,trialListId,seriesNo - the experiment plan, and the trial list within that plan, and the sequential number (0-based) of the rule set in the trial list
    <li>learned - "true" or "false" depending on whether the player has "demonstrated learning" in that series (i.e. managed to make the prescribed number [targetStreak] of consecutive error free moves)
    <li>total_moves - the total number of move and pick attempts in all episodes of the series
    <li>total_errors - the total number of failed move and pick attempts in the series
    <li>mStar - the number of errors (i.e. failed move and pick attempts) the player has made in this series before he "demonstrated learning", or the <em>defaultMStar</em> value (which can be <tt>infinity</tt>) if the learning was not demonstrated (or if it took more than <em>defaultMStar</em> errors to achieve learning).
  </ul>
  
    <h3>(3) M-W computations with imported mStar data</h3>
  
<p>Use this mode if you want to carry out the M-W computations with mStar data that you have computed yourself, using other tools. (Those tools, of course, may consist of a simple <tt>perl</tt> or <tt>awk</tt> script post-processing the CSV file produced in (2)).


  <pre>scripts/analyze-transcripts-mwh.sh  <em>[MWOptions] [otherOptions]</em> -import inputFileName.csv
</pre>

<p>Note that while you cannot supply the extraction options in this mode, you can still supply M-W options (namely, <tt>-precMode</tt>).

<p>The input file can be in the exactly same format as the one used for the putput file in (2). (Thus, your post-processing script may, for example, simply remove some data rows from the file, e.g. based on the playerId). However, if you produce the mStar data in a different way, you can choose to omit some columns. The only columns you must keep are <tt>ruleSetName</tt> and <tt>mStar</tt>.

<p>All other columns are optional. Specifically, if the <tt>precedingRules</tt> column is present, its content can be used together with the ruleSetName to qualify the experience (as per the <tt>-precMode</tt> option). If the columns <tt>learned,total_moves,total_errors</tt> are present, they will be used for various statistics in the report; if they are absent, the corresponding fields of the report table will be blank or zeros or similarly non-informative.
