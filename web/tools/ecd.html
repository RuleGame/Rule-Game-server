  <h1>Drawing and annotating ECD curves</h1>

<div align="center"><em>Updated 2024-03-22, for Game Server 6.026</em></div>

  <p>This document is meant to describe the functionality of the script <tt>scripts/ecd.sh</tt>, which is designed to draw and annotate the ECD curves describing the cumulative distribution of human players with respect to their speed of learning. The underlying Java class is <tt>edu.wisc.game.tools.pooling.Ecd</tt>.

    <p>At present, the documentation is not available on this page yet. Please read the comments in the script itself, and in the Java file.
