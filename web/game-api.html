  <h1>RESTful API for the use by the Rule Game client - first batch</h1>
  
  <p align="center"><em>Ver 1.010, 2020-09-01</em></p>


  <p>The "first batch" (prefix=<tt>/GameService</tt>) of the Rule Game web API consists of calls that can be used for players that do not participate in any experiments (i.e. don't have player IDs, don't have any trial lists associated with them, etc). This is suitable e.g. for the research interface, for the research team members to develop and test rule sets.</p>

<p>This API includes several HTTP request/response pairs that can be used by the TypeScript/React GUI. Conceptually, its functionality is fairly similar to that of the 
<a href="package.html">Captive Game Server</a> (used by the ML programs), but is customized for the needs of a GUI app used by human players. And, of course, the client communicates with it over HTTP, instead of pipes or the socket level.</p>

<h3>Deprecated methods for players enrolled in experiments</h3>

<p>Methods described in this section were developed before it was clearly understood how the logic is to be divided between the client and server code; so they are not to be used, and the methods from the <a href="game-api-2.html">Second Batch</a> are to be used instead.</p>

<ol>
<li>POST <strong><tt>startTrial:</tt> Start a player's interaction with the system, and obtain a randomly selected trial list for this player</strong>
  <form method="post" action="game-data/GameService/startTrial"
	 enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
     <input name="playerId" type="text" size="25" value="AnyText">
	  <input type="submit">
  </form>
  <p>The input parameter is the player ID (a string). In the future, the system will determine, based on the player ID, what experiment the person is enrolled into (e.g MTurkers vs. psych students vs. ourselves testing a particular game); at present, the player ID does not really matter, as everybody is considered to be enrolled in the experiment called "default".</P>

  <p>Return value: a JSON structure containing the content of one trial list, randomly selected among all trial lists used in this experiment. This structure is a list of ParaSet structure, each of them is similar to those that <tt>getParaSet</tt> would select. A typical returned structure:
<pre>
  [{"clearing_threshold":1.3,"max_points":10,"b":1.5,"min_points":2,"max_colors":4,"f":4,"feedback_switches":"fixed","min_objects":4,"m":9,"n":1,"clear_how_many":2,"bonus_extra_pts":3,"rule_id":"TD-01","max_objects":6,"grid_memory_show_order":false,"min_shapes":4,"stack_memory_show_order":false,"max_shapes":4,"min_colors":3,"stack_memory_depth":6,"max_boards":5,"activate_bonus_at":2},
  {"clearing_threshold":1.3,"max_points":10,"b":1.5,"min_points":2,"max_colors":4,"f":4,"feedback_switches":"fixed","min_objects":4,"m":9,"n":1,"clear_how_many":2,"bonus_extra_pts":3,"rule_id":"TD-02","max_objects":6,"grid_memory_show_order":false,"min_shapes":4,"stack_memory_show_order":false,"max_shapes":4,"min_colors":3,"stack_memory_depth":6,"max_boards":5,"activate_bonus_at":2},
  {"clearing_threshold":1.3,"max_points":10,"b":1.5,"min_points":2,"max_colors":4,"f":4,"feedback_switches":"fixed","min_objects":4,"m":9,"n":1,"clear_how_many":2,"bonus_extra_pts":3,"rule_id":"TD-03","max_objects":6,"grid_memory_show_order":false,"min_shapes":4,"stack_memory_show_order":false,"max_shapes":4,"min_colors":3,"stack_memory_depth":6,"max_boards":5,"activate_bonus_at":2},
  ...
  ...
  ]
    </pre>
    </p>

    <li>[Note: this method is not needed anymore, as it is superseded by <tt>startTrial:</tt>!] GET <strong>getParaSet: Retrieve a parameter set:</strong>
   <form method="get" action="game-data/GameService/getParaSet"
	 enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
     Name: <input name="name" type="text" value="param-1">
	  <input type="submit">
   </form>
<p>
  The argument is the name of the parameter set.</p>

<P>The return value is a JSON object, which may look like this: <tt>
    {"max_points":10, "min_points":3, "max_colors":4,
    "feedback_switches":"fixed",
    "error":false,
    "clear_how_many":4, "max_objects":8, "grid_memory_show_order":true,
    "min_shapes":2, "stack_memory_show_order":true, "activate_bonus_at":3, "clearing_threshold":1.2, "b":0.1, "f":0.2,
    "errmsg":"No error",
    "min_objects":2, "m":10, "n":4, "bonus_extra_pts":10,
    "rule_id":"rule-1",
    "name":"param-1", "max_shapes":4, "min_colors":1,
    "stack_memory_depth":16, "max_boards":5} </tt>. In the return value, the boolean field <tt>error</tt> contains <tt>false</tt> if the parameter set has been successfully retrieved, or  <tt>true</tt> if an error has been encountered (e.g. no parameter set with this name exists). The field  <tt>errmsg</tt>, if provided, may contain a human-readable error message.</p>

   <p>
   (The data will be retrieved from a CSV file in the directory <tt>/opt/tomcat/game-data/param/ </tt> on the server. The file name consists of the name of the parameter set and extension ".csv").</p>

   <p>The server does not know the semantics of the fields in the CSV file, nor does it know what the type of each field is supposed to be (integer vs. boolean vs. string). If the value in a field looks like a number or a boolean, the server treats it accordingly; otherwise, the field value is treated as a string.</p>

	     <li>the <tt>code</tt> value that may provide more details on the operation results;
	     <li>the <tt>finishCode</tt> value which indicates whether the game still goes on, has finished (the board has been cleared), or has stalemated;
	     <li>the <tt>board</tt> object that desribes the current board (what pieces are currently on the board, and whither they can be moved). The code is negative if the request was not understood (reference to a non-existent episode, missing or malformed parameters etc), positive if the request was valid but the piece could not be moved, and 0 if the requested piece has been moved.
	     <li>The value <tt>attemptCnt</tt> is incremented by one on each valid request (regardless of whether the piece requested was moved or not). Therefore, when calling <tt>move</tt>, the supplied value of the <tt>attemptCnt</tt> parameter should be 0 on the first move;   on subsequent calls, it should be equal to the value of attemptCnt returned by the previous <tt>move</tt> call.</p>
