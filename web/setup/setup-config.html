    <h1>Setup: master config file</h1>

    <p>The master configuration file can be created to override the default values of some parameters.

    <p>If you want to have a master configuration file, you need to place it to the location <tt>/opt/w2020/w2020.conf</tt>.  You will need to use the <tt>sudo</tt> command  to create the directory for that file.

    <p>The content of that file may look as follows:

<pre>
#--- This is the master configuration file for the Rule Game Server.
#--- It is located in /opt/w2020/w2020.conf

#--- The Rule Game server input data directory. The Game Server will read
#--- experiment control files from it
FILES_GAME_DATA = "/opt/tomcat/game-data";

#----The Rule Game server saved data directory.
#--- The Game Server will write transcript files etc to it.
FILES_SAVED =  "/opt/tomcat/saved";

#---- The user name for the MySQL server
JDBC_USER = "game"
#---- The password for the MySQL server
JDBC_PASSWORD = "Meerkat-w2020";	
</pre>	


As you can see, you can use this file to modify the locations of the Game Server <a href="../data.html">data directories</a>, as well as the user name and password for the MySQL server account used by the Game Server.
