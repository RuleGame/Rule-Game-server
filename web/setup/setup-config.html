    <h1>Setup: master config file</h1>

    <p>The master configuration file can be created to override the default values of some parameters.

    <p>If you want to have a master configuration file, you need to place it to the location <tt>/opt/w2020/w2020.conf</tt>.  You will need to use the <tt>sudo</tt> command  to create the directory for that file.

    <p>The content of that file may look as follows:

<pre class="yellow">
#--- This is the master configuration file for the Rule Game Server.
#--- It is located in /opt/w2020/w2020.conf

#--- The Rule Game server input data directory. The Game Server will read
#--- experiment control files from it
FILES_GAME_DATA = "/opt/tomcat/game-data";

#----The Rule Game server saved data directory.
#--- The Game Server will write transcript files etc to it.
FILES_SAVED =  "/opt/tomcat/saved";

#---- The user name for the MySQL server
JDBC_USER = "game"
#---- The password for the MySQL server
JDBC_PASSWORD = "meerkat";	

#---- The URL for the Rule Game GUI Client (prod and dev versions)
GUI_PROD = "http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/rule-game/prod/";
GUI_DEV = "http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/rule-game/dev/";
</pre>	

<p>
  As you can see, you can use this file to modify the locations of the Game Server <a href="../data.html">data directories</a>. For example, you may choose to put them under <tt>/opt/w2020</tt>. You also use this config file to specify the user name and password for the MySQL server account used by the Game Server.

<p>The parameters <tt>GUI_PROD</tt> and <tt>GUI_DEV</tt> specify the URLs for the GUI client, i.e. the URLs to which your server will link from its launch pages, such as <a href="../front-end-form.jsp">main launch page</a></strong>, or the <a href="../launch/">MLC launch  page</a>. If you follow the <a href="index.html#A">Setup Option A</a> or  <a href="index.html#B">Setup Option B</a>, keep the values of these parameters as shown above, because your players will still load the GUI client from our server (<tt>sapir</tt>) at UWM.  If you follow  <a href="index.html#C">Setup Option C</a>, you will find instructions how to modify those parameters' values.
