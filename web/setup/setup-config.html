    <h1>Setup: master config file</h1>

    <p align="center"><em>Updated 2024-03-06</em></p>

    <p>The master configuration file, which the Rule Gane server reads upon startup, can be created to override the default values of some parameters.  Normally, you <strong>should</strong> create it, because the password you use for the MySQL server is likely not the "default" one!

    <p>If you want to have a master configuration file, you need to place it to the location <tt>/opt/w2020/w2020.conf</tt>.  You will need to use the <tt>sudo</tt> command  to create the directory for that file.

    <p>The content of that file may look as follows:

<pre class="yellow">
#--- This is the master configuration file for the Rule Game Server.
#--- It is located in /opt/w2020/w2020.conf

#--- The Rule Game server input data directory. The Game Server will read
#--- experiment control files from it
FILES_GAME_DATA = "/opt/w2020/game-data";

#----The Rule Game server saved data directory.
#--- The Game Server will write transcript files etc to it.
FILES_SAVED =  "/opt/w2020/saved";

#---- The name of the database on you MySQL server that your Rule Game Server uses
JDBC_DATABASE = "game";
#---- The user name for the MySQL server
JDBC_USER = "game";
<strong>#---- The password for the MySQL server. Change this is needed. Typically, this is the only field you need to change
JDBC_PASSWORD = "meerkat";</strong>	

#---- The URL for the Rule Game GUI Client (prod and dev versions)
GUI_PROD = "/rule-game/prod/";
GUI_DEV = "/rule-game/dev/";
</pre>	


<h4>Data file locations</h4>
<p>
  As you can see, you can use this file to modify the locations of the Game Server <a href="../data.html">data directories</a>. In the above example, we use the recommended locations, under <tt>/opt/w2020</tt>. In the past, on some servers we put those directories under <tt>/opt/tomcat</tt> instead, but that's probably not a very good choice.

<p>Whatever location you have chosen for the data directories, you need to create them:
  <pre>
    cd /opt/w2020
    mkdir saved
    mkdir game-data
    </pre>

  <p>When creating those two directories, make sure that the Linux user <tt>tomcat</tt> (which runs the Tomcat server) can read fromboth of these directories, and to write to the <tt>saved</tt> directory. You can do this  e.g. by transferring their ownership to that user:
    <pre>
sudo mkdir /opt/w2020/game-data /opt/w2020/saved
sudo chown tomcat.tomcat  /opt/w2020/game-data /opt/w2020/saved
    </pre>


  
  <h4>MySQL server info</h4>
<p>
You also use this config file to specify the user name and password for the MySQL server account used by the Game Server. Normally, you'll keep the account name (<tt>game</tt>), but will modify the password value, based on whatever you have set for that user name.


<h4>Relative locations of the server app and the client app</h4>

    <p>The parameters <tt>GUI_PROD</tt> and <tt>GUI_DEV</tt> specify the URLs for the GUI client, i.e. the URLs to which your server will link from its launch pages, such as <a href="../front-end-form.jsp">main launch page</a></strong>, or the <a href="../launch/">MLC launch  page</a>. If you follow the standard setup process we describe (either 
<a href="index.html#A">Setup Option A</a> or  <a href="index.html#B">Setup Option B</a>), keep the values of these parameters as shown above; these are relative URLs, because your players will load the GUI client from the same host where your game server runs.

<p>
However, it is also possible to run a non-standard setup, with the client app sitting at a different location from the server. In this case, an absolute URL is needed:
<pre>GUI_PROD = "http://myHostName/rule-game/prod/";
GUI_DEV = "http://myHostName/rule-game/dev/";</pre>


<h3>Config file ownership</h3>

<p>For a bit of security, consider changing the ownership of this file to the user that runs (or will run) Tomcat on your machine (on Linux, typically, that's user <tt>tomcat</tt>), and making it only readable by that user.

<p>You can later edit this file with e.g.
  <pre>
    sudo -u tomcat emacs w2020.conf
  </pre>
