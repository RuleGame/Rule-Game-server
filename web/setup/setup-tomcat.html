    <h1>Setup: Tomcat</h1>

https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi
    
    
    <p>We suggest that you run the Apache Tomcat as user <tt>tomcat</tt>. You can follow fairly standard installation and configuration instructions compiled by  Justin Ellingwood at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-tomcat-10-on-ubuntu-20-04">How To Install Apache Tomcat 10 on Ubuntu 20.04</a>. (His site has instructions for earlier versions of Tomcat and for other Linux versions as well).
      

<p>In particular, you'll need to create a Linux user group named <tt>tomcat</tt>, and a user of the same name:      
<pre>    
sudo groupadd tomcat
sudo useradd -s /bin/false -g tomcat -d /opt/tomcat tomcat
</pre>
Also, do not forget to do:
<pre>
chmod +x /opt/tomcat/bin/*.sh
chown tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat/conf
</pre>

<p>(This is to avoid this problem:
<pre>
  30-Jun-2020 01:58:03.276 SEVERE [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.beforeStart Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.36/conf/Catalina/localhost]
</pre>)

<p>We recommend that you intall Tomcat in <tt>/opt/tomcat/</tt> (which usually is the default location). If you install it elsewhere, you may need to adjust some scripts and configuration files.
      

<p>You can check whether tomcat is running with something like
  <pre>
    ps -auxw | grep tomcat
  </pre>
If it is not, you can start it with
  <pre>
sudo systemctl start tomcat
  </pre>
  or
  <pre>
sudo service tomcat start
  </pre>
  , depending on how your OS is set up.

<p>If the tomcat is running properly, you can see the tomcat's main page by going to an appropriate URL in your browser, such as http://localhost:8080/ . (The port number, of course, is based on how you have configured the Tomcat; you may have chosen to change 8080 to 80, which can be omitted in URLs).

  <h2>Create data directories for Game Server</h2>

<p>You need to create the the Game Server <a href="../data.html">data directories</a>. At our site, we have the Rule Game server input data directory at
  <tt>/opt/tomcat/game-data</tt>, and the saved data directory, at <tt>/opt/tomcat/saved</tt>. If you prefer, you can choose to put these two directories elsewhere, e.g. under <tt>/opt/w2020</tt>.

  <p>Once you have created these two directories, set the values for the two relevant variables in your  <a href="setup-config.html">config file</a> accordingly, e.g.
<pre>
FILES_GAME_DATA = "/opt/tomcat/game-data";
FILES_SAVED =  "/opt/tomcat/saved";
</pre>

  <p>When creating those two directories, make sure that the Linux user <tt>tomcat</tt> (which runs the Tomcat server) can write to those directories, e.g. by transferring their ownership to that user:
    <pre>
sudo mkdir /opt/tomcat/game-data /opt/tomcat/saved
sudo chown tomcat.tomcat  /opt/tomcat/game-data /opt/tomcat/saved
    </pre>

    <h2>Extra libraries</h2>

  <p>You will need an extra JAR file installed to provide for connectivity between the Java applications (such as the Game Server) and your relational database.
(If you don't, you will have a runtime error mentioning <tt>com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver</tt> when you try to use the Game Server).

  <p>
    If your database server is the MySQL server, then the     necessary JAR file can be downloaded from the  <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/">Connector/J</a> site. At that site, choose the appropriate version for your OS.

  <p>On our system, we have put that JAR file into
    <tt>/opt/w2020/lib</tt> (earlier, in     <tt>/usr/share/java</tt>),
    and sym-linked it to Tomcat's library directory, so that the web application could find it in run time:
    <pre>
    cd /opt/tomcat/lib
    sudo ln -s /opt/w2020/lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.20.jar
    </pre>

  <p>As of 2023, the above web site offers you downloading in the form a *.deb file, e.g. mysql-connector-j_8.1.0-1ubuntu22.04_all.deb . Once downloaded, you can install it with
    <pre>
      dpkg -i mysql-connector-j_8.1.0-1ubuntu22.04_all.deb
    </pre>
    To find out what files you have actually downloaded by doing this, try
    <pre>
$ dpkg-deb -c mysql-connector-j_8.1.0-1ubuntu22.04_all.deb 
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2023-06-26 12:10 ./
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2023-06-26 12:10 ./usr/
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2023-06-26 12:10 ./usr/share/
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2023-06-26 12:10 ./usr/share/doc/
...
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2023-06-26 12:10 ./usr/share/java/
-rw-r--r-- root/root   2485886 2023-06-26 12:10 ./usr/share/java/mysql-connector-j-8.1.0.jar
lrwxrwxrwx root/root         0 2023-06-26 12:10 ./usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java-8.1.0.jar -> mysql-connector-j-8.1.0.jar
    </pre>
    So this tells you where the JAR file gets installed, and you can simply sym-link it into Tomcat's lib directory, instead of copying it.

    <h2>Running on port 80</h2>

    <p>By default, Tomcat is configured to run on port 8080. If you desire to run it on port 80 instead, you need to modify Tomcat's config file (server.xml), and to allow user <tt>tomcat</tt> to use port 80. (By default, only user  <tt>root</tt>  can use this port, and other ports with numbers before 2024). For instructions, see e.g. <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/tomcat-change-port">https://www.baeldung.com/tomcat-change-port</a>
    
    <h2>MacOS notes</h2>

    <p>
      If your server runs on MacOS, rather than Linux, then it's likely that your Tomcat has been installed using Homebrew, and lives somewhere like /usr/local/opt/tomcat/libexec/ rather than /opt/tomcat. In this case you may need to either change the line in build.xml that refers to the tomcat library directory, or, for compatibility's sake, provide a few symlinks:

      <pre>
	mkdir /opt
	cd /opt
	ln -s /usr/local/opt/tomcat/libexec tomcat
	</pre>
