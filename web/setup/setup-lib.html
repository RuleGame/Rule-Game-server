    <h1>Setup: Third-party libraries</h1>

<p>If you follow <a href="index.html#B">Setup Option B</a>, you will need to download a few third-party libraries before you can compile the Rule Game Server from source.
    
<ul>
  <li>Apache OpenJPA: from <a href="https://openjpa.apache.org/downloads.html">OpenJPA Downloads</a>. This is a library used by the Game Server to store data in the SQL server in an "object-oriented way".  On our development host we have OpenJPA 3.1, and have it installed in <tt>/opt/apache-openjpa-3.1.0</tt>. You may choose to download a more recent version, or to install OpenJPA to a different location; if you do that, then, before compiling the Rule Game Server from source, you will need to modify as appropriate the following line in <tt>build.xml</tt>:
<pre>    
  &lt;property name="openjpa"  location="/opt/apache-openjpa-3.1.0"/&gt;
</pre>
</ul>
