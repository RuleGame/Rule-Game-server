    <h1>Setup: Experiment Control Files </h1>

    <p>To run experiments (i.e. let people play according to the rules you have set up, with s), you need a set of experiment control files for each experiment you want to be played.

    <p>For some background on how experiment plans describe an experiment, see "Experiment plans and trial lists" in <a href="../concepts.html">The main concepts</a>, and  Read-only data: experiment control files
      in the <a href="../data.html#in">Data guide</a>. More practical details are found in <a href="../sop-experiment.html">Standard Operating Procedures: Preparing and running an experiment with the Rule Game Server</a>, and in other documents in the  "<a href="../index.html/design">Designing an experiment</a>" section of our documentation library.
      

      <h2>"Borrowing" UWM's set of experiment control files</h2>
      
    <p>A complete set of control files for an experiment can be created from scratch, as per the SOP instructions. However, as you can see from the documentation above, the system of control files needed for a non-trivial experiment may be fairly complex. Therefore, in order  to get accustomed to different types of experiment plans, and to  different ways in which experiment plans can be designed, it may be convenient for you to start with taking wholesale the entire set of our experiment plans, and then work off that base.

    <p>Our team at UWM has experiment control files at two different GitHub repositories. Members of the <a href="https://github.com/lupyanlab">Lupyan Lab</a> can use the repository <a href="https://github.com/lupyanlab/Rule-Game-game-data">Rule-Game-game-data</a>; however, this repository is not visible to outside customers. Researchers from outside the Lupyan Lab can download the content of the public repository  <strong><a href="https://github.com/vmenkov/Rule-Game-server">Rule-Game-server</a></strong> instead. This repository contains a sampling of experiment control files as well, in the directory <tt>game-data</tt>.

    <p>You can download the files from the public repository, and install the data in your desired data directory, as follows. (We assume that you use subdirectory <tt>w2020</tt> under your home directory as a temporary staging area, and that the location of the experiemnt file directory is set in your  <a href="setup-config.html">master config file</a> with <pre>
	FILES_GAME_DATA = "/opt/tomcat/game-data";
</pre>).	
 

<pre class="yellow">
  cd
  mkdir w2020
  cd w2020
  mkdir game-data
  cd game-data
  git init
  git remote add origin https://github.com/lupyanlab/Rule-Game-game-data.git
  git pull origin master
  sudo cp -pa game-data /opt/w2020
</pre>

<p>
Once the experiment control files have been installed, you may try to play some games based on them. You can start a game session from the main launch page, whose URL is like <tt><a href="../front-end-form.jsp">http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu:7150/w2020/front-end-form.jsp</a></tt>, but of course with your own host name and port name (if not 80) instead of ours.

<p>
Later on, as we add more control files to the repository, you can update your local copy of these files as follows:
<pre class="yellow">
  cd ~/w2020/game
  git pull origin master
  sudo cp -pa game-data /opt/w2020
</pre>

<h2>Skipping the staging directory</h2>

<p>If you're just using the experiment control files from our repository, without any intent to modify them, you can skip creating the staging directory on your server, and to check out the control files from the GitHub repository directly to the experiment control file directory of your sever.

<p>Here we assume that this directory is /opt/w2020/game-data, and that it's owned by user <tt>tomcat</tt> (because that's the user who runs the Tomcat process, and therefore needs to read those files):
  <pre>
  sudo -u tomcat mkdir /opt/w2020/game-data/
  cd /opt/w2020/game-data/
  sudo -u tomcat git init
  sudo -u tomcat git remote add origin https://github.com/lupyanlab/Rule-Game-game-data.git
  sudo -u tomcat git pull origin master
  </pre>



<h2>Creating your own experiment control files</h2>

<p>Once you have understood, with the help of the <a href="../data.html#in">Data guide</a> and the <a href="../syntax.html">Rule Syntax Guide</a>,  some of the examples supplied via our GitHub repository, you may want to start creating your own experiment plans.

<p>The simplest way to do that is by creating the necessary files (typically, this means creating at least one trial list file and at least one rule set file), and manually placing them in appropriate subdirectory under your <em>FILES_GAME_DATA</em> directory). While this is fine for a small project, we will suggest that if you plan to do a substantial amount of experiment plan development, you should invest in creating your own repository on GitHub (or with some other version-control system) for storing your experiment control files.

  <h3>Manual deployment with GitHub</h3>
<p>
  If the entirety of your development work will take place on the same computer that runs your Game Server, then, in principle, you can simply treat your  <em>FILES_GAME_DATA</em> directory as the local directory associate with the GitHub repository, and edit the files right there. If your project has a more complicated organization (various people editing files on their personal computers; some others prefer doing editing via the GitHub web interface), then you may consider creating a framework similar to what we do at Lupyan Lab. You can arrange for either  manual or automatic updates. For manual updates, you can establish a standard operating procedure whereby a team member who checks some updates to your data repository will need to login (<tt>ssh</tt>) to your server, check out the data to his local directory, and then copy them over to the   <em>FILES_GAME_DATA</em> directory. (Or, of course, as it's been already mentioned above, he can save a step and check the data out directly to the   <em>FILES_GAME_DATA</em> directory.) As an example, see our <a href="../sop-experiment.html">Standard Operating Procedures: Preparing and running an experiment with the Rule Game Server</a>.

  <h3>Automatic deployment with GitHub Actions</h3>
  
<p>Alternatively, you can set up automatic deployments using the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions">GitHub Actions mechanism</a>.  This is how it could work (as per the mechanism set up by Kevin Mui for our team's data repository):

  <ul>
    <li>Every time one of your team members  checks in an update to your repository, the GitHub server will transmit a snapshot of a modified directory to your server. (For that to happen,  you will also need to configure the appropriate actions in the Actions Tab of your data repository; for additional instructions on how to do that, see Kevin's <a href="game-data/README.md">README.md</a> file and  <a href="game-data/master.yml">master.yml</a> file).

    <li>A program on your server (such as  by Kevin's  <a href="https://github.com/kmui2/github-actions-server">github-actions-server</a>) will soon notice the arrival of the update, and will deploy it to the server's   <em>FILES_GAME_DATA</em> directory.      
  </ul>
