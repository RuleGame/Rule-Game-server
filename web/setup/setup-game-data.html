    <h1>Setup: Experiment Control Files </h1>

    <p>To run experiments (i.e. let people play according to the rules you have set up), you need a set of experiment control files for each experiment you want to be played.

    <p>For some background on how experiment plans describe an experiment, see "Experiment plans and trial lists" in <a href="../concepts.html">The main concepts</a>, and  Read-only data: experiment control files
      in the <a href="../data.html#in">Data guide</a>. More practical details are found in <a href="../sop-experiment.html">Standard Operating Procedures: Preparing and running an experiment with the Rule Game Server</a>, and in other documents in the  "<a href="../index.html/design">Designing an experiment</a>" section of our documentation library.

    <p>A complete set of control files for an experiment can be created from scratch, as per the SOP instructions. However, to get accustomed to different types of experiment plans, and to  different ways in which experiment plans can be designed, it may be convenient for you to start with taking wholesale the entire set of our experiment plans, and then work off that base.

    <p>To do that, ....
