    <h1>Setup: Experiment Control Files </h1>

    <p>To run experiments (i.e. let people play according to the rules you have set up), you need a set of experiment control files for each experiment you want to be played.

    <p>For some background on how experiment plans describe an experiment, see "Experiment plans and trial lists" in <a href="../concepts.html">The main concepts</a>, and  Read-only data: experiment control files
      in the <a href="../data.html#in">Data guide</a>. More practical details are found in <a href="../sop-experiment.html">Standard Operating Procedures: Preparing and running an experiment with the Rule Game Server</a>, and in other documents in the  "<a href="../index.html/design">Designing an experiment</a>" section of our documentation library.
      

      <h2>"Borrowing" UWM's set of experiment control files</h2>
      
    <p>A complete set of control files for an experiment can be created from scratch, as per the SOP instructions. However, as you can see from the documentation above, the system of control files needed for a non-trivial experiment may be fairly complex. Therefore, in order  to get accustomed to different types of experiment plans, and to  different ways in which experiment plans can be designed, it may be convenient for you to start with taking wholesale the entire set of our experiment plans, and then work off that base.

    <p>Our team at UWM has experiment control files at two different GitHub repositories. Members of the <a href="https://github.com/lupyanlab">Lupyan Lab</a> can use the repository <a href="https://github.com/lupyanlab/Rule-Game-game-data">Rule-Game-game-data</a>; however, this repository is not visible to outside customers. Researchers from outside the Lupyan Lab can download the content of the public repository  <strong><a href="https://github.com/vmenkov/Rule-Game-server">Rule-Game-server</a></strong> instead. This repository contains a sampling of experiment control files as well, in the directory <tt>game-data</tt>.

    <p>You can download the files from the public repository, and install the data in your desired data directory, as follows. (We assume that you use subdirectory <tt>w2020</tt> under your home directory as a temporary staging area, and that the location of the experiemnt file directory is set in your  <a href="setup-config.html">master config file</a> with <pre>
	FILES_GAME_DATA = "/opt/tomcat/game-data";
</pre>).	
 

<pre class="yellow">
  cd
  mkdir w2020
  cd w2020
  mkdir game
  cd game
  git init
  git remote add origin https://github.com/vmenkov/Rule-Game-server.git
  git pull origin master
  sudo cp -pa game-data /opt/w2020
</pre>

<p>
Once the experiment control files have been installed, you may try to play some games based on them. You can start a game session from the main launch page, whose URL is like <tt><a href="../front-end-form.jsp">http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu:7150/w2020/front-end-form.jsp</a></tt>, but of course with your own host name and port name (if not 80) instead of ours.

<p>
Later on, as we add more control files to the repository, you can update your local copy of these files as follows:
<pre class="yellow">
  cd ~/w2020/game
  git pull origin master
  sudo cp -pa game-data /opt/w2020
</pre>

<h2>Creating your own experiment control files</h2>
