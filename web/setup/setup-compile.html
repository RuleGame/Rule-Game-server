    <h1>Setup:  Compiling the server</h1>

    <p>If you have chosen the setup  <a href="index.html#B">Option B (or C)</a>, you are going to compile the Rule Game Server from its source code.

    <P>We assume that you already have a Java compiler (<tt>javac</tt>) and Apache Ant, and that you have downloaded the  <a href="setup-lib.html">required libraries</a> into the recommended directories under <tt>~/w2020</tt>.

    <p>Now you need to download the source code of the server from the GitHub repository. You can do it as follows:
  <pre>
  cd   ~/w2020	     
  mkdir game
  cd game
  git init
  git remote add origin https://github.com/vmenkov/Rule-Game-server.git
  git pull origin master	   </pre>	   
<p>If you have Apache Ant installed, you can now compile the source  code and build a WAR file:
<pre>
  cd ~/w2020/game
  ant clean javadoc war
</pre>

<p>You can then install the WAR file on your Tomcat server:
<pre>  
  cp ../w2020.war /opt/tomcat/webapps	     </pre>

<h2>Adjusting library references</h2>

  <p>If you are using different versions of some libraries than those we did, you will have compilation errors or runtime errors ("Class not found", "Cannot obtain a JDBC connection", etc), because the Java compiler or the Java runtime cannot find them. If that happens, edit <tt>build.xml</tt> and <tt>scripts/ scripts/set-var.sh</tt>, modifying library paths as appropriate. E.g. references to
      <tt>/opt/apache-openjpa-3.1.0</tt>,  <tt>commons-math3-3.6.1</tt>,
<tt>/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java-8.0.20.jar</tt>    etc may need to be updated.



<h2>Modifying the application</h2>

<p>If you are interested in customizing the Game Server for your needs (e.g. extending the rule syntax), you can study the source code, the <a href="../api/">class documentation (Java API)</a>, and <a href="../">general documentation</a>, and edit the source code as needed. Then build the WAR application file with <tt>ant</tt>, and install, as per the above section.

<p>If you are doing a substantial amount of development, using multiple computers, you may consider setting up your own GitHub repository for your source code, and have a "standard operating procedure" for managing the code and deployments, similar to <a href="../deploy.html">what we have</a>.
