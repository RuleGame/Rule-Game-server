<h2>Maintaining and deploying server code and server data</h2>

<p>The Game Server source code (including documentation web pages) and the <a href="data.html#in">read-only data</a> (CSV files which control the experiments) are handled as outlined in the chart below:</p>

<a href="img/deploy.svg"><img src="img/deploy.png" height="600"></a>

  <p>The chart includes the following locations:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. The GitHub repository</strong> is the place where the "master code" of the server code and read-only data is stored. The location is as follows: <a href="https://github.com/vmenkov/Rule-Game-server">Rule-Game-server</a>. If you need access to this project, send your Github account name to Vladimir, and ask to add you to the list of contributors.

      <li><strong>2. Your work directory on your home of office computer.</strong> You can create and modify code and data files on any computer which is convenient for you to use, such as your home or office computer. For illustration, let's assume that the place where you work on this project is <tt>~/w2020</tt>.
	
      <li><strong>3. Your work directory on <tt>sapir</tt>.</strong> <tt>Sapir</tt> is just a Linux machine, and is as good as any place to work on editing more files. However, your work directory on sapir (let's assume it's also  <tt>~/w2020</tt>) is a particularly important place, since from there you can deploy code and data to the server directory.

      <li><strong>4. "live" code.</strong> The "running" Web Rule Game server's code is located in <tt>/opt/tomcat/webapps/w2020</tt>. You don't touch this directory directly, but deploy code there using the procedure outlioned in (c) below.

      <li><strong>5. "live" data.</strong>  The "running" Web Rule Game server reads its read-only data from CSV files that are located under  <tt>/opt/tomcat/game-data</tt>. In order to ensure that your files don't just disappear after a subsequent deployment, it is preferably that you don't edit data files directly in this directory. Instead, deploy data  files to here from your sapir working directory (3) using the deployment procedure described in (d) below.
    </ul>
  </p>
  
<p>You may carry out the following procedures:
       <ul>
	 <li><strong>(a) Check out.</strong> Before you start working on the serve code and data, either on your home computer (2) or on sapir (3), you need to get the current version of the project's files from the GitHub server. You can do it as follows:
	   <pre>
  cd ~/w2020	     
  mkdir game
  cd game
  git init
  git remote add origin https://github.com/vmenkov/Rule-Game-server.git
  git pull origin master	   </pre>	   
	   Later, you can update the files in your working directory from the Github repository every now and then as follows:
	   <pre>
  cd ~/w2020/game	     
  git pull origin master	   </pre>
Besides <tt>git</tt>, there are various other command-line and visual client applications that work with Github (e.g. <tt>svn</tt>). If you use one of those, modify the above commands as appropriate for your client.
	   <br>
	   Various subdirectories of <tt>game</tt> containing the following materials:
	   <ul>
	     <li><tt>game-data</tt> - read-only data files (rule sets, experiment plans, etc). See the <a href="data.html#in">Data Guide</a> for more info).
	     <li><tt>web</tt> - documentation
	     <li><tt>src</tt> - server source code
	   </ul>
	 </li>
	 <br>
	 
	 <li><strong>(b) Check in.</strong> Once you have done some work in your working directory (either on your home computer (2) or on sapir (3)), you may want to send your updated files to the Github repository, so that you or other contributors can continue working with them on other machines. Do it as follows:
	   <ol>
	     <li>If you have created any new files or directories, make sure that they are tracked by the version control. For example, if you have created a new experiment plan named <tt>MyPlan</tt> and the rule sets named <tt>My-Rule-01.txt</tt> thru
 <tt>My-Rule-01.txt</tt>, you can "register" them with the version control with
	       <pre>
  cd ~/w2020/game
  cd game-data
  git add trial-lists/MyPlan rules/My-Rule-*.txt	       </pre>
	       <li>Send all new and updated files to the Github repository:
	       <pre>
  cd ~/w2020/game
  git commit -a	     
  git push origin 	     </pre>
</ol>
	 <li><strong>(c) Deploy code to production server.</strong> If you have modified the server code and want to deploy it to the "live" production server, you can do it as follows:
	   <ol>
	     <li>Make sure that the directory <tt>/opt/ant/bin</tt> has been added to your PATH on sapir (edit your <tt>.cshrc</tt>, <tt>.login</tt>, or what have you).
	     <li>Make sure that the working directory on sapir contains the current version of the code (it is current because you have either just modified it right here, or have pulled the current version from Github, as per (a)).
	       <li>Execute the following commands:
		 <pre>
  cd ~/w2020/game
  ant clean javadoc war
  cp ../w2020.war /opt/tomcat/webapps	     </pre>
		 The <tt>ant</tt> command above compiles the source code, and packs the compiled code, along with the documentation and third-party libraries, into a large file in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_(file_format)">WAR</a> format. The <tt>sudo cp</tt> command above copies that WAR file to a directory from which the Apache Tomcat server will automatically pick it and deploy it to the server web application directory, updating all necessary files in <tt>/opt/tomcat/webapps/w2020</tt>. Your applications will then be visible at the web server, at a URL such as <tt>http://localhost:8080/w2020/</tt> or <tt>http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu:7150/w2020/</tt> (depending on what host you are deploying it at, and what port the Tomcat server on that host is using).<br>
		 If the <tt>cp</tt> command above fails because you don't have the right permissions, see the <a href="#permissions">permissions section</a> below; or, if you are very impatient, just repeat the command with <tt>sudo</tt>, i.e.
<pre>sudo cp ../w2020.war /opt/tomcat/webapps	     </pre>
	   </ol>
	   Note that the above only deploys the code, but not the data; to deploy the data, use (d) below instead.<br><br>

<li><strong>(c') Deploy code to development server.</strong> Along with the main (production) web application, <tt>w2020</tt>, your Tomcat server can also run a development web applicatin, <tt>w2020-dev</tt>. To deploy your code as the development application, run <tt>ant</tt> with the target   <tt>war-dev</tt>, rather than  <tt>war</tt>. That will produce a differently-named WAR files, for you to install in the webapps directory:
  		 <pre>
  cd ~/w2020/game
  ant clean javadoc war-dev
  cp ../w2020-dev.war /opt/tomcat/webapps	     </pre>


	 <li><strong>(d) Deploy data.</strong>  For your convenience, the data files are deployed separately from the code. The simplest way to do it is to copy the entire data directory to the server location (5):
	   <pre>
  cd ~/w2020/game
  sudo cp game-data /opt/tomcat/game-data
  sudo chown -R tomcat.tomcat /opt/tomcat/game-data	   </pre>
	   The <tt>chown</tt> command above, while not always necessary, will ensure that the deployed files are owned by user <tt>tomcat</tt>, which is the user that runs the Apache Tomcat server, and therefore will guarantee that the server won't have any problems reading the data files.<br>

	   In general, you don't need to copy the entire input data directory; if you know what you are doing, you can just copy individual files or subdirectories from <tt>~/w2020/game/game-data</tt> to the corresponding locations under <tt>/opt/tomcat/game-data</tt>.<br>

	   As with deploying the application, it would be better if instead of using <tt>sudo</tt> when working with the files in the <tt>game-data</tt> tree, you use <tt>newgrp tomcat</tt>. See  <a href="#permissions">permissions section</a> for details.

       </ul>
</p>


<h2>Production server vs. development server</h2>

<p>As discussed above ((c) vs. (c')), the two are implemented as two web apps within the same Tomcat server. Both presently (ver. 2.001) use the same data files and the same MySQL database. This normally should not cause problems, unless you make the kind of change (in dev vs prod) that requires a change in the database schema.

  <h2><a name="permissions">File ownership and permissions</a></h2>

<p>On a Linux system, every file and directory is owned by a specific user account, and is assigned to a specific UNIX user group. Most of the files under <tt>/opt/tomcat/webapps</tt> on sapir are owned by user <tt>tomcat</tt>, group <tt>tomcat</tt>, and it's a good idea to keep it this way, or as close to it as possible. Therefore, one of the two ways of copying your WAR file to that directory is encouraged.

  <h3>Being a member of group <tt>tomcat</tt></h3>

<p>Presently, most team members have been enrolled into the UNIX group <tt>tomcat</tt>. If you are one of those, then, when you log in to sapir, just type
  <pre>newgrp tomcat</pre>
  and all your subsequent interactions with the system will be as a member of that group. So you should be able to copy files to  <tt>/opt/tomcat/webapps</tt>, since that directory is group-writeable.

  <h3>Using <tt>sudo</tt></h3>

  <p>
If you have <tt>sudo</tt> rights, you of course can copy WAR files to the webapps directory using sudo. But if you do that, do a nice thing and change their ownership to <tt>tomcat.tomcat</tt> thereafter, so that they won't be in the way of other people:
  <pre>sudo cp ../w2020.war /opt/tomcat/webapps
sudo chown tomcat.tomcat      /opt/tomcat/webapps/w2020.war
  </pre>

  
<h2>Client code</h2>

  <p>The client (the TypeScript/React/JavaScript application that runs inside the web browser) has its own Github repository,    <a href="https://github.com/lupyanlab/Rule-Game">Rule-Game</a>. Kevin can provide more details on the deployment process.
