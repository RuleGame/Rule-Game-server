<P><strong>Display a single board</strong></p>
  
  <form method="post" action="game-data/BoardDisplayService/displayBoard"
	enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
    Please enter a JSON element in the box below<br>
	<textarea id="board.data" name="boardJson" rows="10" cols="70">

  Or you can upload a JSON file (as an example, you can pick anything from under <tt>/opt/tomcat/game-data/boards/</tt>) :<br>
  <form  enctype="multipart/form-data"
  	 action="game-data/BoardDisplayService/displayBoardFile"
	 method="post">
<input type="file" size="80" name="file">
<button type="submit">Upload JSON file</button>
</form>

  
  <p>
    A sample board JSON element (using legacy shapes and colors) may look like this:
    <pre>
      {"id":"it-does-not-matter-what-goes-here",
      "value":[
      {"color":"yellow","shape":"square","id":"1","x":1,"y":1},
      {"color":"black","shape":"square","id":"6","x":6,"y":1},
      {"color":"red","shape":"square","id":"31","x":1,"y":6},
      {"color":"blue","shape":"square","id":"36","x":6,"y":6}],
 "name":"Four squares in corners"}
    </pre>
    You can copy and paste one from the output of the Game Server, if you use the Captive Game Server or HTML Play in the web server.
    
  <p>
  You can have boards with images too, e.g.:
    <pre>
      {"id":0,"x":4,"y":3,"image":"vm/image_test_01/cat-07.png","buckets":[]},
      {"id":1,"x":1,"y":4,"image":"vm/image_test_01/cat-03.png","buckets":[]},
      {"id":2,"x":1,"y":5,"image":"vm/image_test_01/cat-03.png","buckets":[]},
      {"id":3,"x":6,"y":6,"image":"vm/image_test_01/cat-13.png","buckets":[0]}]}
</pre>
  
<P><strong>Display a list of boards</strong></p>
  
  <form method="post" action="game-data/BoardDisplayService/displayBoardList"
	enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
    Please enter a JSON element in the box below<br>
	<textarea id="board.data" name="boardListJson" rows="10" cols="70">
	</textarea><br>

    
	  <input type="submit">
	</form>

  <p>Example:
    <pre>
      {"boards":[
      {"id":"Board 1",
      "value":[
      {"color":"yellow","shape":"square","id":"1","x":1,"y":1},
      {"color":"black","shape":"square","id":"6","x":6,"y":1},
      {"color":"red","shape":"square","id":"31","x":1,"y":6},
      {"color":"blue","shape":"square","id":"36","x":6,"y":6}],
      "name":"Four squares in corners"},
  {"id":"Board 2",
      "value":[
      {"color":"yellow","shape":"square","id":"1","x":2,"y":2},
      {"color":"black","shape":"square","id":"6","x":5,"y":2},
      {"color":"red","shape":"square","id":"31","x":2,"y":5},
      {"color":"blue","shape":"square","id":"36","x":5,"y":5}],
      "name":"Four squares near corners"} ]}
    </pre>
