<h2>Display a single board - copy and paste</h2>
  
  <form method="post" action="game-data/BoardDisplayService/displayBoard"
	enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
    Please enter a JSON element in the box below<br>
	<textarea id="board.data" name="boardJson" rows="15" cols="70">
	</textarea><br>	
	The size of each game piece: <input type="text" name="cellWidth" value="60">

	<br><button type="submit">Display the board described above</button>
	</form>

<p>

  <p>
    A sample board JSON element (using legacy shapes and colors) may look like this:
    <pre>
      {"id":"it-does-not-matter-what-goes-here",
      "value":[
      {"color":"yellow","shape":"square","id":"1","x":1,"y":1},
      {"color":"black","shape":"square","id":"6","x":6,"y":1},
      {"color":"red","shape":"square","id":"31","x":1,"y":6},
      {"color":"blue","shape":"square","id":"36","x":6,"y":6}],
 "name":"Four squares in corners"}
    </pre>
    You can copy and paste one from the output of the Game Server, if you use the Captive Game Server or HTML Play in the web server.
    
  <p>
  You can have boards with images too, e.g.:
  <pre>
{"id":"cats","value":[
   {"id":0,"x":4,"y":3,"image":"vm/image_test_01/cat-07.png","buckets":[]},
   {"id":1,"x":1,"y":4,"image":"vm/image_test_01/cat-03.png","buckets":[]},
   {"id":2,"x":1,"y":5,"image":"vm/image_test_01/cat-03.png","buckets":[]},
   {"id":3,"x":6,"y":6,"image":"vm/image_test_01/cat-13.png","buckets":[0]}
],
 "name":"Some cats"}
</pre>
