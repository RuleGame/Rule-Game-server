<h1>How to set up APP and MLC launch pages: instructions for the experiment manager</h1>

   <p align="center"><em>Updated 2021-11-20 for Game Server ver. 4.002</em></p>

<p>This document helps the experiment manager to set up the "launch pages" for the APP and MLC users.

<h2>Setting up the APP launch page</h2>

<p>This is how you can get a particular rule set to appear in one of the two tables in the <a href="launch-rules.jsp">APP launch page</a>.
 

<h3>Part A: pre-created trial lists</h3>

<p>The <strong>Part A table</strong>  consists of experiment plans which you have chosen to appear there. There are two ways to get an experiment plan to appear in that table:
  <ul>
    <lI>You can list the experiment plan as one of the entries in the "launch file", <tt>launch/launch-app.csv</tt> under the main control file directory (<tt>/opt/tomcat/game-data</tt>). The launch file is a 2-column CSV file; the first column contains an experiment plan name (e.g. <tt>foo</tt> for an experiment plan whose trial list files are in the directory  <tt>trial-lists/foo</tt> under the main control file directory), and the second column contain an arbitrary text which will be displayed by the server as part of the plan's description.
      <li>Alternatively, you can place the experiment plan's directory within the directory   <tt>rules/APP</tt> under the main control file directory. (This can be at any  depth in the directory tree).
  </ul>
  
<p>
Either way, every experiment plan you include in the Part A table should contain exactly 1 trial list (because we want player assignment to be deterministic here). The trial list file must may contain one or several data lines (after the usual header line);  most likely you will want to have just one data line (unless you want the player to go through two or more rule sets). As in any trial list, each line will specify the name of the rule set you want to expose, along with other necessary control parameters.

<p>As in any trial list, the rule set name (in the <tt>rule_id</tt> column of the trial list file) is the path name of the rule file relative to the main rules directory (<tt>rules</tt>). The rule set file may, but does not have to, be located in <tt>rules/APP</tt>.

<p>You may want to use the Part A table if your rule set needs to be used with some "non-standard" parameters, such as an unusual number of game pieces, a set of custom colors or custom shapes, a set of <a href="../para-set.html#defineBoard">custom initial boards</a>, etc. Another reason to use the Part A table (specifically, the "launch file" listing is when you, for some reason, want to have a trial list with several lines (this, several rule sets) in it, and you want to write a description for the entire experiment plan (in addition to any descriptions found in the comment lines of individual rule set files).

<p>The columns of the Part A table  correspond to "short modifier files" from <tt>modifers/APP-short</tt>; each of those files only contains columns corresponding to the feedback modalities and the giving-up option. For each table cell, the game server will combine the trial list of the relevant experiment plan with the columns of the relevant modifier file, the later overriding the former. (This is referred to as a "P:" type dynamic experiment plan).   For example, if you have a static plan <tt>APP/foo</tt>, the dynamic plans will have names such as <tt>P:APP/foo:APP-short/APP-short-no-feedback</tt>

<h3>Part B: "naked" rule sets</h3>

<p>The <strong>Part B table</strong> is generated directly based on the rule sets you have provided. You need to place those rules set files into <tt>rules/APP</tt> (or anywhere in the directory tree under that directory). 

<p>If any of the rule set files in the <tt>rules/APP</tt> directory tree is already used in part A (because it's referenced in an experiment plan that appears in this part), it will be ignored by the server in part B, in order to avoid repetition (and also to avoid  presenting such a rule set without its proper custom-designed trial list file, and thus possibly failing to supply some parameters necessary for that rule set).

<p>The columns of the table correspond to "long modifier files" from <tt>modifers/APP</tt>; each of those files contains all columns that one would normally find in a "simple" trial list file (one that only uses legacy shapes and legacy colors), with the exception of the ruleSet column. For each table cell, the game server will dynamically create a trial list based on the relevant rule set and the relevant  modifier file. (This is referred to as an "R:" type dynamic experiment plan).  For example, if you have a rule set named <tt>APP/foo</tt>, the dynamic plans will have names such as <tt>R:APP/foo:APP/APP-no-feedback</tt>


<h2>Setting up the MLC launch page</h2>

<P>For the <a href="index.jsp">MLC launch page</a>, the setup rules are very similar to those for the APP launch page. Just replace <tt>APP</tt> with <tt>MLC</tt> and  <tt>app</tt> with <tt>mlc</tt> in all directory and file names. (Except for the files and directories for the modifier files; for the moment, we use the APP modifiers for MLC too).
