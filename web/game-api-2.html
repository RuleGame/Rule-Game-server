  <h1>RESTful API for the use by the Rule Game client - second batch</h1>

  <p align="center"><em>Ver 1.011,  2020-09-03</em></p>

  <p>This is the "Second Batch" (prefix=<tt>/GameService2</tt>)  of the Game Service web API calls. They are intended for use with a client app that works with players enrolled in experiments; each player is identified by a player ID, and the server assigns each player to a "trial list" (a particular track in the experiment plan with which this player ID is associated with).</p>

  <p>For calls used by players not enrolled in experiments (e.g. our own team members developing and testing games), see <a href="game-api.html">the First Batch</a>.</P>
    
  
  <ol>
<li>POST <strong><tt>/startTrial:</tt> Start a player's interaction with the system, and obtain a randomly selected trial list for this player</strong>
  <form method="post" action="game-data/GameService2/player"
	 enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
     Player ID: <input name="playerId" type="text" size="25" value="AnyText-01">
	  <input type="submit">
  </form>
  <p>The input parameter is the player ID (a string). In the future, the system will determine, based on the player ID, what experiment the person is enrolled into (e.g MTurkers vs. psych students vs. ourselves testing a particular game); at present, the player ID does not really matter, as everybody is considered to be enrolled in the experiment called "default".</P>

  <p>Sample output:
    <pre>
      {"errmsg":"Debug:...",
      "error":false,
      "newlyRegistered":false,
      "trialListId":"trial_1"}
    </pre>
    
    In practice, you don't need any of the returned values, other than the error code.</p></li>

<p>As of ver. 1.011, in the board description the field <tt>dropped</tt> is shown only in the pieces that have been already removed from the board; the value is the ientifying number (0 thru 3) of the bucket into which the piece has been dropped.</p>

	<li>POST <strong><tt>/giveUp:</tt> "Gives up" the current series (i.e. the series played with the current param set), so that the next episode will be run with the next param set.</strong> If this is invoked while an episode is in progress, the episode will be marked as "given up" as well. However, you may choose to only used this call at the end of an episode (that is, give the player an option of switching to the next param set for the next episode, regardless of one's current position in the current series).

  <br>The seriesNo value must be exactly the same to which the current (or just completed) episode belongs to, as per the "seriesNo" value obtained in the last /newEpisode call. This is required as a safety check, to ensure that the client and server are on the same page. (If it's an annoyance to have it, I can remove this parameter)
