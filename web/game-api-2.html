  <h1>Web API for the use by the Rule Game client - second batch</h1>

  <p align="center"><em>Version 2.005,  2021-03-10</em></p>

  <p>This is the "Second Batch" (prefix=<tt>/GameService2</tt>)  of the Game Service web API calls. They are intended for use with a client app that works with players enrolled in experiments; each player is identified by a player ID, and the server assigns each player to a "trial list" (a particular track in the experiment plan with which this player ID is associated with).</p>

  <p>For calls that can be used by players not enrolled in experiments (e.g. our own team members developing and testing games), see <a href="game-api.html">the First Batch</a>.</P>
    
  
  <ol>

    <li>GET <strong><tt>/getVersion:</tt> Report the currently deployed version of the Game Server.</strong>
	<form method="get" action="game-data/GameService2/getVersion">
	  <button type="submit">Get version!</button>
	</form>

    <li>POST <strong><tt>/player:</tt> Start a player's interaction with the system, and obtain a randomly selected trial list for this player</strong>
  <form method="post" action="game-data/GameService2/player"
	 enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
     Player ID: <input name="playerId" type="text" size="25" value="AnyText01"><br>
     Experiment plan (optional, e.g <tt>qt</tt> or <tt>pk1</tt>): <input name="exp" type="text" size="25" value="">
	  <input type="submit">
  </form>
  <p>The input parameter is the player ID (a string). In the future, the system will determine, based on the player ID, what experiment the person is enrolled into (e.g MTurkers vs. psych students vs. ourselves testing a particular game); at present, the player ID does not really matter, as everybody is considered to be enrolled in the experiment called "default".</P>

  <p>For the meaning of the output fields, see the documentation for <a href="api/edu/wisc/game/rest/PlayerResponse.html">PlayerResponse</a>. A field named <tt>foo</tt> will be described there under <tt>getFoo()</tt> or (for boolean values) <tt>isFoo()</tt>.

    <p>Ver. 1.021: added <tt>trialList</tt>, which is a vector with one element per line of the trial list. Can be used to find the total number of rule sets to which a player will be exposed.</p>
    
  <p>Sample output:

 <li>POST <strong><tt>/pick</tt>: Pick a piece:</strong>
      <form method="post" action="game-data/GameService2/pick"

      </form>

The arguments to the <tt>/pick</tt> call are similar to those used in a /move call, except that there are no bucket coordinates. Unlike /move, a /pick call merely asks whether the piece in question can be moved to <em>any</em> position, but does not actually move it to anywhere.   The return value is the same JSON structure as a move call would return; look at the <tt>code</tt> field, with the same ACCEPT/DENY semantics. Here, ACCEPT (code 0) means that the piece can be moved to at least one bucket; DENY (code 4) indicates that the piece cannot be moved to any bucket.

   <p>The response contains a structure, <tt>transitionMap</tt>, which can be used to create a set of button offering the player possible further actions. The structure describes buttons in terms of key/value pairs, where the key tells where you'll get if you click the button, and the value tells how you can get there.
     Listed below  are all possible key/value pairs, and their semantics.

     
     <table border=1>

	   <tr><td>MAIN <td> DEFAULT <td>Next episode <td> Call /newEpisode, which will produce another main-subseries (non-bonus) episode in the same series</tr>
	   <tr><td>BONUS <td>DEFAULT <td>Next episode <td> Call /newEpisode, which will produce another bonus episode in the same series</tr>
	   <tr><td>NEXT <td>DEFAULT <td>Next series<td> Call /newEpisode, which will automatically start the first episode of the next series (because no more episodes can be started in the current series)</tr>
	   <tr><td>END <td>DEFAULT<td>Finish<td>The end of the last series, and of the experiment.     Call /newEpisode. It will return error=true, allFinished=true, and completionCode, which the GUI client can then display to the player</tr>

	   <tr><td>NEXT <td>GIVE_UP <td>Give up (and proceed to the next series) <td> Call /giveUp (which will switch series) followed by /newEpisode.  (Or simply call /newEpisode with giveUp=true). The first episode of the next series will start</tr>
	   <tr><td>END <td>GIVE_UP<td>Give up (and end the last series, and the experiment)<td>Call /newEpisode with giveUp=true. It will return error=true, allFinished=true, and completionCode, which the GUI client can then display to the player. </tr>
     </table>

     <p>A button with value="DEFAULT" is produced after every episode, indicating the default action (continuing in the same series, switching to the next series if the current series is done, or finishing one's work after the last series). A button with value="GIVE_UP" is produced after every episode other than the last episode of a series; it indicates the player's ability to end a series prematurely (and then go to the next series, if available). A button with value="ACTIVATE" is produced after main-subseries episodes if the player is eligibile to switch to ("activate") the bonus subseries.</p>

	<pre>
	  {"RED":[220,20,0],
	  "PINK":[220,100,100],
	  "BLUE":[30,90,210],
	  "errmsg":"No error",
	  "BLACK":[0,0,0],

	  "PURPLE":[200,0,200],
	  "error":false,
	  "GREEN":[0,250,0]}
	</pre>
	The hash table may also contain fields "error" and "errmsg". If an error has happened (e.g. the color map file on server could not be parsed), the error field will be set to true, and errmsg will contain an explanation of sorts.

<li>GET <strong><tt>/listShapes</tt></strong>: shows the currently supported shapes.

        <form method="get" action="game-data/GameService2/listShapes"
	 enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
	  <input type="submit">
	</form>
	This should return a structure with the field named <tt>value</tt> whose value is a list of shapes. E.g.:<pre>
{"error":false,
"values":["cloud-lightning","moon","blank","cloud-off","sun","cloud","cloud-rain","cloud-drizzle","triangle","star","cloud-snow","arrows/arrow-up","arrows/arrow-left","arrows/arrow-down-left","arrows/arrow-down-right","arrows/arrow-up-left","arrows/arrow-right","arrows/arrow-up-right","arrows/arrow-down","square","circle"]}
	  </pre>
The shape names are given using the same case as in the file names. They are not case-sensitive, though.
	<br>
	If an error happens, a structure with an error field is returned instead:
	<pre>
{"error":true, "errmsg": "And this is why: ..."}
	  </pre>
	
<li>GET <strong><tt>admin/getSvg.jsp</tt></strong> -- Get SVG file:
  <form method="get" action="admin/getSvg.jsp">
    <input type="text" name="shape" value="STAR" size="20">
    <input type="submit">
  </form>

  This should return an SVG file (e.g. /opt/tomcat/game-data/shapes/star.svg for argument STAR), with content type image/svg+xml. In the case of an error (e.g. no such file), error code 404 will be returned.

<h2><a name="html">HTML play</a></h2>

<p>The "HTML play" can be used to play some episodes in the web browser, without the use of the client GUI app. This allows to test the Game Server functionality separately from that of the client GUI app.

<p>Note: for technical reasons, in the HTML play the game pieces are drawn in black, and their assigned color (slightly "watered down", for better visibility) is indicated by the background of the cell. This is different from how the pieces appear in the GUI client.

  <h2><a name="clear">Clear tables</a></h2>

<p>For efficiency sakes, the Game Service tends to cache certain data, such as parsed rule sets. If you modify a trial list file or a rule set file that already exists under /opt/tomcat/game-data, you may want to force the server to purge its stored tables, to ensure that your updated files will be re-read.

  <form method="post" action="game-data/CheckPlanService/clearTables"
	 enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">    
     <button type="submit">Clear tables!</button>
   </form> 
  
  <h2><a name="checkPlan">Validate your experiment plan</a></h2>

<P>You can use this form to check your experiment plan's input files for errors (syntax errors, references to non-existent files, attempts to generate boards with non-existence colors or shapes, etc). Just enter the name of your experiment plan and click on "Submit".
  
   <form method="post" action="game-data/CheckPlanService/checkPlan"
