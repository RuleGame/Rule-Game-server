  <h1>Using custom shapes and colors in Rule Game Server 2.*</h1>

    <p align="center"><em>Updated for Ver 2.000,  2020-12-22</em></p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The original Game Server 1.*, and Kevin GUI client that worked with it, restricted the experiment designer to the 4 built-in shapes and 4 built-in colors. These restrictions have been removed in Game Server 2.*. This document is intended to familiarize the experiment manager with the procedures he or she needs to use to create an experiment plan that uses pieces of arbitrary custom shapes and colors.

    <h2>Defining Colors</h2>

  <p>You can use arbitrary colors in Game Server 2.*. Once you have decided what colors will be used for game pieces (objects) in your new experiment (e.g. <tt>SIENNA</tt>, <tt>TERRA_COTTA</tt>, and <tt>UMBER</tt>), add the definitions of your chosen colors <strong><a href="data.html#color">to the color map file</a></strong> on the server. After this is done, you can refer to these colors in the game rule files (just like you used the 4 legacy colors in Game Server 1.*), in the (<a name="data.html#defineBoard">definitions of predefined initial boards</a>  and in the list of colors for random board generation (see below).</p>
