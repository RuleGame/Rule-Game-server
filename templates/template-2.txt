# For each shape, there are two randomly chosen permanent designated
# buckets (sometimes just one, if both random choices are identical).
# For each shape, there is a specific randomly chosen order (e.g. T,
# B, L1) in which they can be picked from the board. For each shape,
# a certain number of pieces (Xcnt, ranging from 1 to 4, as per the
# param file) can be picked before the control falls to the next line.
#
# For randomly chosen orders, such a rule set will very often stalemate.
# In one experiment, only 4 non-stalemating rule sets were generated
# out of 100*10 attempts. The successful ones are those which happened
# to have all compatible orders (e.g. T and L1).
