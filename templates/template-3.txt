# For each shape, there are two randomly chosen permanent designated
# buckets (sometimes just one, if both random choices are identical).
# For each shape, there are 2 specific randomly chosen orders (such as
# T, B, L1) in which they can be picked from the board. For each
# shape, a certain number of pieces (Xcnt, ranging from 1 to 4, as per
# the param file) can be picked before the control falls to the next
# line.
