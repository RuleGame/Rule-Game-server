    <h1>Captive Game Server</h1>

<div align="center"><em>Updated 2020-08-31 for ver 1.009</em></div>
    
    <h2>What is the Captive Game Server</h2>

    <p>The Captive Game Server (CGS) is a small Java application that contains the same game engine as the Web Game Server, but does not have a database and does not communicate with clients using HTTP. It is to be started, as a child process, by the client program (such as a machine learning (ML) program that wants to play a game), and communicates with the client using standard input and standard output (i.e. UNIX pipes). For testing purposes, it can also be run directly from the console by a person who wants to play the game himself.</p>

    <p>Since the Captive Game Server is run by the owner of the ML program, the latter has complete control how many times it's run, and with what data. It is a complete "honor system", so to speak. Thus, it is up to the owner of the ML program to keep track of how the CGS is used, how many game episodes were played, and how many moves were attempted in each episode.</p>

    <p>To distinguish this version of the CGS from the socket-based version discussed later in this document, we will refer to it as the <em>pipe-based</em>.

  <h2>Third-part JAR files</h2>

    <p>If you're using CGS instaled on <tt>sapir</tt>, you can safely ignore this section. But if you are installing the CGS on your own machine, you also need to obtain a set of third-party JAR files that are used for working with JSON-format data. This is how: You can download a file such as jaxrs-ri-2.31.zip (from e.g. https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.glassfish.jersey.bundles/jaxrs-ri ) and unpack it on your machine in such a way that, for example, if you have the CGS code unpacked in   <tt>~/somedir/game</tt> (that's the directory in which various shell scripts are), then you also have the directory <tt>~/somedir/jaxrs-ri</tt>.</p>


    <p>For example: suppose you have downloaded both the CGS distribution file (e.g. captive-1.003-2020-08-07.zip, or a later version) and jaxrs-ri-2.31.zip into your home directory. Then you do the following to unpack the files into properly positioned directories:
      <pre>
	cd
	mkdir captive
	cd captive
	unzip ~/captive-1.003-2020-08-07.zip
	unzip ~/jaxrs-ri-2.31.zip
      </pre>


    <p>
In this way CGS can find relevant JAR files (used for handling JSON) in <tt>../jaxrs-ri/ext/*.jar</tt>, relative to the directory  where the scripts are. This is how the class path is set in the shell scripts (specifically, in <tt>set-var-captive.sh</tt>, which is included into <tt>captive-brief.sh</tt> and other scripts).</p>

      
    <h2>Starting the Captive Game Server</h2>

    <p>The CGS is presently installed on sapir, in the directory <tt>/home/vmenkov/captive.</tt> The CGS can play one game at a time; to choose a game, one needs to provide the CGS with a game rule file (a few of which can be found in  /home/vmenkov/captive/game/rules/ ) and the initial number of pieces. 

      <p>To use CGS, you need to add the directory <tt>/opt/jdk-14.0.2/bin</tt> into your path. Alternatively, you can modify the shell scripts mentioned below, so that they use <tt>/opt/jdk-14.0.2/bin/java</tt> rather than just <tt>java</tt>.

      
    <p>
      You can run the CGS from the command line as follows:
      <pre>
/home/vmenkov/captive/game/captive-full.sh /home/vmenkov/captive/game/rules/rules-02.txt 8
      </pre>
This will start a session using the rule description from the specified file; each episode will use a random initial board with 8 pieces.

      <p>During the session, you will be able to type commands on the console, and the program will send the output to your screen. Type HELP to see the list of command, or EXIT to exit.
    </p>

    <p>To use the CGS with your ML program, use the standard mechanism for spawning a child process, starting the script (captive-full.sh, captive-standard.sh, or captive-brief.sh) as a child process from your program. Capture the CGS's standard input and standard output via pipes, and communicate with it via writing into one pipe and reading from the other.</p>


    <h3>Specifying the initial board</h3>

    <p>The command line arguments for the scripts such as <tt>captive-full.sh</tt> are the same as for the underlying Java program, <tt>edu.wisc.game.engine.Captive</tt>. The first argument is always the name (path) of the text file containing the rule set description. The additional arguments specify the initial board, or the random distribution from which initial boards are drawn in each episodes. There are several ways to do this:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Specific board file identified by name:
	<pre>
 ./captive-full.sh game-data/rules/farthest.txt game-data/boards/four-corners.json 
	</pre>
	If you do that, every episode in your session will start with the same identical initial board.
      <li>Specify only the number of pieces, as a single number:
 	<pre>
 ./captive-full.sh game-data/rules/farthest.txt 3
	</pre>
	In this example, every episode will start with a random board with the same number (3) pieces. The shapes and colors of each piece will be selected independently from each other from the entire set of shapes and colors available, which means that the number of shapes and colors will vary in each episode over the entire possible range.
	  <li>Specify only the number of pieces, as a single number:
 	<pre>
 ./captive-full.sh game-data/rules/farthest.txt 2:4
	</pre>
	In the above example, for each episode the number of pieces will be selected randomly, with a uniform distribution, from the speciified range, meaning that, on average, one-third of all initial boards will have 2 pieces, one-third will have 3, and one-third will have 4.
	  <li>Specify the number of pieces, the number of shapes, and the number of colors, as single numbers:
 	<pre>
 ./captive-full.sh game-data/rules/farthest.txt 5 2 3
	</pre>
	In the above example, every initial board will have 5 pieces, with exactly 2 distinct shapes and 3 distinct colors
	 <li>Same as the above, but with using ranges for any of the three quantities. Ranges and single numbers can be combined in arbitrary ways; essentially, a single number <em>n</em> is equivalent to the range <em>n</em>:<em>n</em>. E.g.
  	<pre>
 ./captive-full.sh game-data/rules/farthest.txt 5 1:3 3:4
	</pre>
	In the above example,  every initial board will have 5 pieces, with 1, 2, or 3 distinct shapes (with equal probability) and 3 or 4 distinct colors.
    </ol>

    <p>Presently (ver. 1.009), it is expected that the human-subject experiments will use experiment plans (trial lists) specifying ranges of the number of pieces, the number of shapes, and the number of colors. When the distribution parameters are specified in this way, the captive server uses exactly the same random board generation process as  is used in the human-subject experiments.</p>
    

<h3>Talking to the CGS from a Java application</h3>
    
    <p>If your ML application is in Java, you can use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessBuilder.html">ProcessBuilder</a> API to spawn child processes and deal with their I/O. You create a <tt>Process</tt> object, write your commands to the stream returned by <tt>Process.getInputStream()</tt>, and read responses from the stream returned by <tt>Process.getOutputStream()</tt></p>

    <h3>Talking to the CGS from a Python application</h3>
    
    <p>If your ML application is in Python, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html">subprocess.run</a> for the same purpose.</p>

   <p>For the convenience of ML researchers who may want their ML application written in Python to use the CGS, we provide a sample Python client that spawns a CGS and communicates with it via pipes.
      </p>

    <p>To see how this works, run the script
      <pre>
	./captive-python.sh
      </pre>
      with no arguments. It will set the CLASSPATH as needed to include all relevant JAR files, and will then invoke <tt>python/client.py</tt> with some arguments (rule file and piece count), which in its turn will spawn a CGS and play an episode of the specified game with it, communicating via pipes.
    <p>

    <p>You may want to modify the script <tt>captive-python-socket.sh</tt> as needed to use a different rule file.</p>

    <p>In the Python code, after <tt>python/client.py</tt> spawns the CGS process, it uses code from <tt>python/gameLoop.py</tt> to do the actual communication and playing. In the latter file, the method <tt>chooseMove()</tt> is the one deciding on the next move. In the sample code, the move is done by picking the first moveable piece and trying to put it to a randomly chosen bucket; in a real ML application, some appropriate learning logic would appear here instead.</p>

<p>Below is the console output from a sample session.</p>

    <h2>Game description</h2>

    <P>A few game rule description files have been supplied in  <tt>/home/vmenkov/captive/game/rules/</tt>. The rule description language is mostly described in a document that Paul has posted on Google Docs; ask him for a share link. There are some extensions to this language though. In particular:

      <ul>
	<li>Lines starting with a <tt>#</tt> character are comments (purely for human readers, ignored by the engine)
	<li>The rule lines may be preceded by any number of order definition lines, e.g.
	  <pre>
Order Manchu=[31, 25, 19, 13, 7, 1, 32, 26, 20, 14, 8, 2, ....]
Order fromOutsideIn=[ [1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,13,19,25, 31,32,33,34,35,36, 30,24,18,12], [8,9,10,11, 14,20, 26,27,28,29, 23,17], [15,16,21,22]]
	  </pre>
	  The first line defines an order named <tt>Manchu</tt>,  according to which one must first pick objects in the order in which one reads Manchu or Mongol script, i.e. by column, the columns being arranged from left to right.
	  The second line defines an order named <tt>fromOutsideIn</tt>, according to which one must first pick objects from the cells adjacent to the edge of the square, etc, toward the center.
	<li>Any rule line may start with an integer (global counter). If provided, this rule line can be used at most this many times before the control goes to the next line.
	<li>After the optional global counter, the line must have one or several rule "atoms". Each atom has the format
	  <pre>
	  (counter,shape,color,positionList,bucketFunctions) 
	  </pre>
	  For example, the rule
	  <pre>
	    (*,star,*,fromInsideOut,[0])
	  </pre>
	  says that any number of stars of any color can be picked, as long as they are among the "most inside" pieces of all pieces on the board; once picked, they must be put into bucket no. 0.
	<li>The buckets are numbered clockwise starting from the <strong>top left</strong>. This is in agreement with the current functionality in Paul's and Kevin's GUI app, rather than with Jerry's specs. This, bucket 0 is (7, 0), bucket 1 is (7,7) etc.
</ul>	 
	  
      
<h2>Commands (input) and output</h2>

<p>The input to CGS consists of one-line commands, some with arguments. The output consists of "comment lines" (intended for debugging or human consumption), preceded with '#', and data lines, which do not have a '#'. Your ML program should ignore all comment lines.

<p>Three output modes are available: brief, standard, and full. The full mode contains a large number of comment lines (in particular, a graphic board display); the other two modes don't have comment lines, or only have very few of them. The CGS can be started in any of these modes using one of the 3 scripts provided (captive-full.sh, captive-standard.sh, or captive-brief.sh).

  <h2>The API</h2>

<p>The following are the commands you'll need</p>

<p><strong>The implicit "NEW" command:</strong> when you start the CGS, an episode starts immediately, and you get 2 lines of output right away which are in the same format as for the "NEW" command (below).

<p>
<pre><strong>NEW</strong></pre>

    <p>
    Starts a new episode. You don't need this command at the very beginning of a session, since the first episode starts automatically. Use this command for every successive game. It can be used after the previous episode has completed (with a "win" (clearing the board) or a stalemate (no piece can be moved anymore); it can also be used in the middle of an episode if you give up and want to start a new one.

    <p>Response: two lines. The first line contains 3 numbers, as described in the "MOVE" section below, reflecting the acceptance of the command and the current state. The second line describes the current display. It is in JSON format, and looks as follows:
<br>
<tt>      
  {"id":0,"value":[{"id":0,"color":"BLUE","shape":"CIRCLE","x":4,"y":1,"buckets":[]},{"id":0,"color":"RED","shape":"CIRCLE","x":4,"y":3,"buckets":[0]},{"id":0,"color":"BLUE","shape":"SQUARE","x":3,"y":5,"buckets":[]},{"id":0,"color":"YELLOW","shape":"CIRCLE","x":3,"y":6,"buckets":[]}]}
</tt>
<br>
Here, at the top level the only field that matters is "value". Its value is an array, each elements represents a piece. For example, the piece described as <TT>
{"id":0,"color":"RED","shape":"CIRCLE","x":4,"y":3,"buckets":[0]}</tt> has color RED, shape CIRCLE, is located in row 3, column 4. The field "buckets" is an array containing the list of buckets (see above for numbering!) into which this piece can be moved. If the array size is zero, it means that the piece is not moveable. It is up to your program and its "honor system" to which extent it wants to look into this array!


<p>
  <pre><strong>DISPLAY</strong></pre>

      <p>Response: one line, displaying the current board in the JSON format, in the same format as in the NEW command.</p>

<p>
  <pre><a name="move"><strong>MOVE row col B_row B_col</strong></a></pre>

      This command attempts picks the piece located at (row,col), and to move it to the bucket at (B_row, B_col). The values for the first two coordinates can be in the range [1..6]; the values for each of the last two coordinates must be 0 or 7.
      
      <p>Response: two lines (in the standard mode) or one line (in the brief mode). The first line contains 3 numbers, as follows:
<pre>
  response_code game_state move_count
</pre>

The response_code is 0 for acceptance (successful move), positive for rejection (command is understood and is legal, but the move is denied), negative for an error (command arguments are not legal). More specifically:
<pre>

    public static class CODE {
	public static final int
	// move accepted and processed
	    ACCEPT = 0,
	// Move rejected, and no other move is possible
	// (stalemate). This means that the rule set is bad, and we
	// owe an apology to the player
	    STALEMATE=2,
	// move rejected, because there is no piece in the cell
	    EMPTY_CELL= 3,
	// move rejected, because this destination is not allowed
	    DENY = 4,
	// Exit requested
	    EXIT = 5,
	// New game requested
	    NEW_GAME = 6;
	
	public static final int
	    INVALID_COMMAND= -1,
	    INVALID_ARGUMENTS= -2,
	    INVALID_POS= -3,
	// No game is on now. Start a game first!
	    NO_GAME = -4,
	// Used in socket server GAME  command
	    INVALID_RULES = -5,
	// Used in web app, when trying to access a non-existent episode
	    NO_SUCH_EPISODE = -6,
	// The number of preceding attempts does not match. This may indicate
	// that some HTTP requests have been lost, or a duplicate request
            ATTEMPT_CNT_MISMATCH = -7,
    	// This code is returned on successful DISPLAY calls, to
	// indicate that it was a display (no actual move requested)
	// and not a MOVE	    
	    JUST_A_DISPLAY = -8;

   }	    
</pre>

<p>
The second number, the <strong>finish code</strong> reports the current state: 0=can play (there are pieces on the board, and some can be moved), 1=finish (no pieces left on the board), 2=stalemate (there are pieces on the board, but none of them can be moved anymore).

<p>The third number is the move count, i.e. the total number of attempted and successful moves in this episode so far.

<p>In the standard mode, the status line is followed by a line with the description of the current display, in the same format as in the NEW command. In the brief mode, this line is omitted. You can use the brief mode if your program keeps track of the board itself, and you want to reduce the cost of communication with the CGS.

<p>
  <pre><strong>EXIT</strong></pre>

<p>
  <pre><strong>HELP</strong></pre>

<p>
  <pre><strong>VERSION</strong></pre>
  
  <h2>Human-readable output</h2>

<p>In the "full" output mode, human-readable display is printed with each "DISPLAY", "NEW", or "MOVE" command, as a number of comment lines. In the other modes, the same display is available with the "DISPLAYFULL" command.</p>

<p>The following notation is used: O, #, T, * are circles, squares, triangle, and stars, respectively. The color is not marked in any way.  Dots are empty cells. Round parentheses () surround pieces that can be moved presently. Square bracket surround the cell to which the last MOVE was applied; the cell will be empty [.] if the move was successful (the piece has been removed), or non-empty, e.g. [O], if the move was rejected.</p>

    <h2>Logging</h2>

    <p>There is no logging at present. The ML program is to count its games, and to record displays (e.g. the initial boards) if it so desires.


      <h2>Socket interface</h2>

    <p>An alternative way of running CGS is as a process in a separate console window (or even by a different user, or on a different host) and communicating with it over the socket interface. Unlike the "normal" CGS, the socket game server can serve multiple clients, with a different game rule set for each one; but the client-server session facing each client is still completely controlled by the client and thus can still be described as "captive".</p>

    <h3>Starting the socket CGS</h3>

    <p>In a new console window, run the script <tt>socket-server.sh</tt> with the desired port number as an argument, e.g.
      <pre>
	~/w2020/game>    ./socket-server.sh 7501
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>The socket server will normally not produce any messages, other than reports on rule set files being read at the beginning of each session, if everything goes on normally. Any error messages will go to the screen.</p>

    <p>At this point (ver 1.003) there is no inactive session management in the server, so the clients ought to close their sessions appropriately. When you don't need the server running anymore, you can kill it with Ctrl-C, or with a <tt>kill</tt> command.</p>

    <h3>The socket CGS API</h3>

    <p>The only difference from the normal (pipe-based) CGS API is that the socket CGS has one more command, 
      <pre><strong>GAME "rule-file.txt" nPieces</strong></pre>
      e.g.
      <pre><strong>GAME "rules/rules-01.txt" 5</strong></pre>
</p>

    <p>This command must be used as the first command of the session. It specifies the rule set file to use (the rule file name can specify the absolute file name on the server, or a path relative to the directory where the server was started), and the number of pieces. These arguments are analogous to those used on the command line when starting a pipe-based CGS; however, the rule file name must be double-quoted.</p>

    <P>After the <tt>GAME</tt> command is sent, the socket CGS behaves exactly like the pipe-based CGS does; it reads in a rule file, and starts the first episode, sending back to the client the status line and the JSON display line. Thereafter, the same commands (<tt>MOVE</tt>, <tt>NEW</tt>,  and finally <tt>EXIT</tt>) should be used by the client, exactly as their are in the pipe-based CGS.</p>
    
    <h3>Talking to the socket CGS from the console</h3>

    <p>You can test the socket CGS by running the telnet command on the appropriate port, e.g.

      <pre>
	telnet localhost 7501
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>You can then enter the <tt>GAME</tt> command, followed by <tt>MOVE</tt>, <tt>NEW</tt>,  and <tt>EXIT</tt> as appropriate. For example:

<pre>      
:~> telnet localhost 7501
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

   <h3>Talking to the socket CGS from a Python client</h3>

    <p>For the convenience of ML researchers who may want their ML application written in Python communicate with the socket CGS, we provide a sample Python client doing exactly that.
      </p>

    <p>To see how this works, run the script
      <pre>
	./captive-python-socket.sh
      </pre>
      with no arguments. It will set the CLASSPATH as needed to include all relevant JAR files, and will then invoke <tt>python/client-socket.py</tt> with some arguments (host name, port number, rule file and piece count), which opens a socket connection and plays an episode of the specified game.
    <p>

      <p>You may want to modify the script <tt>captive-python-socket.sh</tt> as needed to use a different host, port, or rule file.</p>
